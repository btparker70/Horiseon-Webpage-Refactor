### What I Learned
This project gave me hands on experience with HTML5's semantic structuring. I learned that semantic structure is imporant for readability for developers, and for accessibility among ADA users and others who browse webpages using text-readers or by other means.

I learned the importance of good commenting and how it improves the readability for yourself and others who look at your code.
